            <p class="container-xxl ">The first Adloyada parade was initiated by Avraham Aldema, a
                teacher and
                co-founder
                of "Hevre Trasek", and was held in Tel Aviv during Purim in 1912. This parade was characterized by
                provocative costumes and pranks. According to several testimonies, the parade of 1912 was very colorful
                and
                beautiful. It consisted of giant puppets, a marching band and hundreds of children wearing their Purim
                costumes. Throughout the years, the parade became a permanent tradition of Purim. These events were held
                parallel to the famous celebrations that were organized by Baruch Agadati. Agadati's merriments had
                become
                extremely profitable, and so were criticized harshly by "Hevre Trasek" for being over commercialized.

                    alt="ben gurion">
                Tel Aviv's Adloyadas were complemented with luxurious Purim balls, created by Baruch Agadati. Throughout
                the
                years, the parades were expanded and their path was moved from Herzl Street to Allenby Street and to Ibn
                Gabirol Street upon the establishment of the state of Israel.

                During the 1930s, every Adloyada had a specific theme, for example the tribes of Israel (in 1934), and
                the
                achievements of the Yishuv. During that time, Tel Aviv's Purim events attracted many tourists from all
                around Israel and from abroad.

                As opposed to European states, where carnivals were a means to break loose and consisted of extreme
                licentiousness, aggressiveness and protest,[citation needed] the Tel Aviv event had different features.
                The
                main carnival, despite its new name Adloyada, was characterized by a "proper" behavior. The municipality
                issued annual limitations on the Purim celebrations such as a prohibition to use explosives and dress up
                in
                costumes that may offend the Jewish religion or the Israeli nation. Despite the censorship and the
                sanctions, there were a few costumes and parades that didn't obey the rules and used the public
                festivity to
                express social protest, and thus made their mark on the city.

                During the 1928 carnival, with the theme "10 years to the national home", Hevre Trasek presented a
                10-candle
                Menorah (as a symbol to Balfour's statement); instead of candles there was a rude gesture and the sign
                "free
                Aliya, Jews in the top clerical work". In one of the "Menorah" balls (Menorah was a club founded by
                veterans) in 1927, Avraham Atkind won the costume competition for his costume: "balancing the clerk's
                salary
                in the Palestine government". Atkind's hat had a scale and a photograph of the residence of the British
                commissioner in the magnificent Augusta Victoria building in Mount Scopus, as well as a poem, expressing
                the
                <img src="./pictures/העדלאידע3.jpg" alt="kids" class="pic2 d-inline rounded ms-2 float-end w-75 ">
                discontent of the gap between the British clerk's salary and the salaries of local Israelis from all
                ethnic
                groups.

                Gdud Meginei Hasafa (Hebrew: גדוד מגיני השפה, Battalion for the Defence of the Language), an
                organization in
                Tel Aviv fighting to make Hebrew the common language in Mandatory Palestine,[5][6] used Purim to present
                and
                to flood the streets with written propaganda. The Gdud documents were distributed during the Purim
                carnival.
                In addition, the Gdud held an annual costume competition with the theme of the superiority and
                importance of
                the Hebrew language. In the carnival of 1929, the Gdud presented the "tower of Babylon"; a tower on top
                of a
                horse-drawn cart with the slogan "revival of the language, revival of the people" and "words can kill".

                In the main carnival of 1933, there was a puppet of Hitler riding a horse, as part of the parade. On its
                neck there was a sign saying; "kill Jews" and next to it there were 2 Jews bleeding to death. The German
                consul in Jerusalem sent a letter to Tel Aviv Mayor Meir Dizengoff in the matter and demanded an
                apology,
                but Dizengoff replied that Purim is a stage for free speech of public opinion. A year later, a huge
                puppet
                was presented with a swastika on its back.

                In 1935, a giant puppet was built, named "the profiteering monster". On the day of festivities, a public
                trial was held for the puppet, during which Dizengoff, Menachem Ussishkin, Chaim Weizmann and Yehoshua
                Hankin ruled that the monster was guilty of various crimes including fraud, spending the people's
                wealth,
                and destruction of the achievements of the pioneers.

                In one of the later carnivals, a group of people dressed as Ku Klux Klan members in order to protest
                racism
                in the United States.

                While Purim festivals became central public events in the 1920s and 1930s for expressing current social
                issues, the holiday events, overall and despite exceptions, were aimed to strengthen national messages
                and
                dominant ideologies. As opposed to its Biblical origin, where Purim constitutes "an opposite world" (the
                fool becomes the king and the king is presented as a fool around town), in Tel Aviv the holiday was
                institutionalized to conserve the social hierarchy and the parades were led by the city's mayor Meir
                Dizengoff, astride a horse.

                During the Second World War, the Adloyada tradition was extinguished.</p>
